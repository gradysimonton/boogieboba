            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Grady S.  I have lived in San Diego, California all of my life.  My wife and kids love making various smoothies and coffee drinks.  A decade ago I was introduced to tapioca balls and milk teas and I was hooked.  At the time I wasn't planing on starting a Boba drink shop, but I was urged by the pandemic to do so.  Our shop is named after my 2 dogs: Boogie and Bo ~ Boogie Boba. We want to provide the best tasting Boba, teas, and coffee drinks at a great price. 
                <br>
                We also want you to get your <strong> Boogie ON!</strong>

            <p>
                <q>I really like the small selecton.  This way I don't have to overthink which drink I want.  The small menu done perfectly is a better than a large menu done lousy.  I love this place.  I'll be definitely coming back. </q>

                <q>The service is great.  I don't know why they call it Booger Boba, but I don't care.  This stuff is like really addictive. It must be the quality ingredients. </q>
